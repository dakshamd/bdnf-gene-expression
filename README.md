# BDNF Gene Expression Dataset

This repository provides a cleaned subset of gene expression data focused on the **BDNF** (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) gene across different mouse brain regions. The dataset and accompanying notebook were created to support targeted scientific analysis in the fields of neuroscience, and psychology.

## 1. About the Dataset

This dataset was compiled by extracting expression values of the **BDNF** gene from a comprehensive gene expression matrix.

**Source**: Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (https://neuroinformatics.nl/HBP/ABA_mouse/)
**Focus**: Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) gene expression
**Purpose**: To create a smaller, focused subset of data that can be used in research on neuroplasticity, learning, memory, and neurological/psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, and Alzheimer's.
