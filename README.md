# BDNF Gene Expression Dataset

This repository provides a cleaned subset of gene expression data focused on the **BDNF** (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) gene across different mouse brain regions. The dataset and accompanying notebook were created to support targeted scientific analysis in the fields of neuroscience, and psychology.

## 1. About the Dataset

This dataset was compiled by extracting expression values of the **BDNF** gene from a comprehensive gene expression matrix.

- **Source**: Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (https://neuroinformatics.nl/HBP/ABA_mouse/)
- **Focus**: Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) gene expression
- **Purpose**: To create a smaller, focused subset of data that can be used in research on neuroplasticity, learning, memory, and neurological/psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, and Alzheimer's.

## 2. Why This Repository is Useful

This repository provides a focused dataset that saves time and computational effort for researchers who are interested in:

- Studying the role of **BDNF** in brain function, particularly in learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity.
- Investigating how changes in BDNF expression may relate to neurological and psychiatric disorders such as **depression**, **anxiety**, and **Alzheimerâ€™s**.
- Accessing a ready-to-use, clean dataset without needing to filter and process the full Allen Brain Atlas data themselves.

## 3. Getting Started

Some ways to get started with this repository:

- **Download or clone the repository to your local machine:** Click the green **Code** button above and select **Download ZIP**, or use Git:
`git clone https://github.com/dakshamd/bdnf-gene-expression.git`
     
- **Access the data:** Open the file `compiled_BDNF_expression (Final).csv` in your preferred tool for data analysis (Python, R, etc.).

- **Reproduce or modify the data:** Open the Notebook `Gene_Expression_Compilation_Notebook.ipynb` to see how the data was compiled and follow the step-by-step instructions listed here to modify or reproduce the dataset.

## 4. How to Use the Data

- **Use `compiled_BDNF_expression.csv` for:**
  - Statistical analysis of BDNF expression across brain regions.
  - Visualization projects in neuroscience or data science.
  - Comparative studies involving other genes or brain structures.

- **To recreate or modify the dataset:**
  - Open `Gene_Expression_Compilation.ipynb`.
  - Follow the documented steps to filter for the **BDNF** gene, clean the data, and export a new subset.
  - You can replace **BDNF** with any other gene listed in the original dataset for further analysis. This flexibility allows users to adapt the process for a wide range of gene expression studies.
